`@skele/system` is a small framework for building extensible application systems using
[Plug-In Architecture](http://wiki.c2.com/?PluginArchitecture).

# Introduction

The aims of the framework are the following:

- allow for application systems that offer ready-made functionality that can be
  altered and customized easily in a defined way, by means of
  - allowing for better _separation of concerns_ by allowing the grouping together of related
    system behavior into separate coarse components -- called **Units**
  - allowing for defining loose coupled interfaces between the Units -- called
    **extensions**

Within the context of this framework, a **Unit** is a collection of functions and
methods that share a common _state_ often an aspect of which is external to the application
written using the framework. More specifically, a Unit is an object containing some
state and functions.

An **extension slot** is a formal declaration of a behavior, related to a _Unit_ that
can be extended (by means of addition or override/replacement) by **dependent Units**.

Lastly, an **extension** is the addition / override that a a **dependent Unit**
contributes to another. The phrase _Unit A contributes an extension
to Unit B_ is also used to describe relationship.

The framework is inspired by <https://github.com/stuartsierra/component> with the addition
of an extension mechanism, which is inspired by work done withn <https://eclipse.org> and
the (Apache Tapestry IOC)[http://tapestry.apache.org/ioc.html].

# Usage

## Defining Units

The simplest way to define a Unit is to provide the Unit-object to the `Unit`
function.

```javascript
import { System, Unit } from '@skele/system'

const example = Unit({
  foo: 1,

  helloWorld() {
    return 'hello world'
  },
})

const hello = example().helloWorld() // => 'hello world'
```

A Unit can also be defined using a funciton, in which case
the framework expects that the funciton returns the Unit itself.

The following example is equivalent to the previous one.

```javascript
import { Unit } from '@skele/system'

const example = Unit(() => {
  var foo = 1

  function hello() {
    return 'hello world'
  }

  return {
    foo,
    hello,
  }
})
```

To work with a unit, one needs an instance of it. To acquire an instance,
one just invokes the unit.

```javascript
const inst = example()

inst.hello() // returns 'hello world'
```

## Systems

A system is simply a composition of a number of named Units (more precisely,
a composition of a number of named _instances_ of Units).

To define a system, we provide a map in which each property is the name of the
_member_ of the system and the value is a reference to a Unit.

```javascript
const hello = Unit({
  /* ... from previous examlle */
})
const example = Unit({
  /* also */
})

const system = System({
  hello,
  hello2: example(), // can also be instantiated directly
})

system.hello.helloWorld()
system.hello2.hello()
```

As shown, alternatively an already instantiated unit can also be used as a value
in the map. In fact, any object can be used.

Systems can also be defined using a function that returns the system map:

```javascript
const system = System(() => ({
  hello,
  hello2: example(),
})
```

## Subsystems

**Subsystems** are systems that can be used in all ways a **Unit** can be used.
With this, we can achieve _comosability of systems_.

```javascript
import { System, Subsystem } from '@skele/system'

const hello = Unit({
  /* ... from previous examlle */
})
const example = Unit({
nt 
})

// the subsystem is defined just like a system
const sub = Subsystem({
  hello,
  example,
})

const sys = System({
  sub, // the subsystem is used like a unit
})

sys.sub.hello.helloWorld()
```

A **subsystem** is a **unit** that is defined in terms of its constituent **units**.
You can use a Subsystem everywhere and in the same way you use a unit, but you
_define_ it like you define a system.

The following expression

```javascript
System({
  /* definition */
})
```

is the equivalent of

```javascript
Subsystem({
  /* definition */
})()
```

I.e. `System` is a just convinience method that gives you an _instantiated_ subsystem.

## Lifecycle

A Unit can optionally can define a `start()` and a`stop()` method. The encompasing
system/subsystem will invoke them upon startup/shutdown.

```javascript
import { Unit, System } from '@skele/system'

const example = Unit(() => {
  var foo = 1

  function hello() {
    return 'hello world'
  }

  function start() {
    // called when the system starts
  }

  function stop() {
    // called when the system stops
  }

  return {
    foo,
    hello,
    start,
    stop,
  }
})
```

Systems and subsystems also define `start` and `stop` methods. They start/stop all
member units.

```javascript
const sys = System({
  example, // as defined above
})

sys.start() // invokes start() on all units
sys.stop() // same
```

## Dependencies

Often units need other units as dependencies. To declare a Unit's
required dependencies, use the function-form definition mechanism and
and decleare the reqiuired dependencies as properties of the first argument:

```javascript
import { System, Unit, using } from '@skele/system'

const configuration = Unit({
  getConfig() {
    return [1, 2]
  },
})

// The example Unit requires a named dependency -- config
const example = Unit(({ config }) => ({
  hello() {
    return `hello with config ${config.getConfig()}`
  },
}))

// to setup the system

const system = System({
  configuration: configuration,
  hello: using({ config: 'configuration' }, example),
  //             ^ reads "configuration as config"
  //               i.e, pass the "configuration" Unit
  //               named as 'config' to hello()
})

// or, in case the name used inside the Unit is the same
// as the name used in the system

const system2 = System({
  config: configuration,
  hello: using(['config'], example), // same as
  hello3: using({ config: 'config' }, example),
})
```

The `using(depMapping, unit)` method is used to realize the Unit's _declared dependencies_
using other Units within the system (by referring to them by name).

The mehod takes an object as a first argument, which indicates which declared depenency
(the property name) should be satisfied with which Unit (a string referring to the other unit by name) from within the system being defined.

### Dependencies and Subsystems

Units can depend on subsystems, just like they can depend on other units.

```javascript
const hello = Unit(({ dependency }) => {})
const sub = Subsystem({
  /* ... */
})

const sys = System({
  sub,
  hello: using({ dependency: 'sub' }, hello),
})
```

Units can also depend on a unit within a subsystem. To achieve that,
use an array (a path)) as the Unit name of the dependency mapping:

```javascript
const hello = Unit(({ dependency }) => {})
const sub = Subsystem({
  nested: Unit({}),
})

const sys = System({
  sub,
  // here we refer to the `nested` unit within `sub` as the dependency
  // specfication
  hello: using({ dependency: ['sub', 'nested'] }, hello),
})
```

This path can be of arbitrary length, therefore units deep inside a subsystem
can be referred to.

Subsystems themselves can also have dependencies (just like Units).

```javascript
const hello = Unit({})
const another = Unit({ anotherDep } => ({}))

// here we use the function form to declare a subsystem that
// requires some dependencies
const sub = Subsystem(( { dependency }) => ({
  // we can use the dependency as a unit within
  someUnit: dependency,
  // we can also 'inject it in another unit
  anotherUnit: using({ anotherDep: dependency }, another)
})
```

## Extensions

The framework provides an **extension mechanism** through which dependant Units can
extend the behaviour base Units in a sort of an inversion of control pattern.

To use the feature, the base Unit must declare an **extension slot**, i.e. to
define a way how dependant Units are able to provide additional functionality.
The extension slot gives shape to the **extensions** usually by providing a
mini-dsl.

A typical usecase for this would be a **router** Unit that can dispatch on any
number of contributed **routes**. Let's examine it.

```javascript
const updateDSL = DSL({
  define: (kind, action, fn) => ({ kind, action, fn }),
})


const groupBy = DSLHelper((group, dsl) => { // would be cool if we don't need to supply methods
  [group]: (arg, body) => {
    const wr = {}
    const result = []
    for (const m of dsl.methods()) {
        wr[m] = (...args) => result.push(dsl[m](arg, ...args))
      }

      body(wr)
      return result
  },
})

const updateSlot = DSL.compose(groupBy('forKind'), updateDSL)

const update = updateSlot()

update.define('foo', 'press', fn)
update.forKind('foo', upds => {
  upds.define('press2', fn )
})

const WithPhase = DSLHelper((phase), dsl) => {
  forPhase: (phase, body) {
    const wr = {}
    const result = []

    for (const m of dsl.methods()) {
      wr[m] = (...args) => result.push({ phase, ...dsl[m](...args)})
    }
  }
}

xform.forPhase('fetching', fetching => {
  fetching.forKind(['foo'], foo => {
    foo.register(xform)
  })
})
```

```javascript
import { Unit, ExtensionSlot } from '@skele/system'

// We define an extesnion slot by providing a function that
// returns a new extension everytime it is called

export const routesSlot = ExtensionSlot(() => {
  const _routes = []

  return {
    // this is a mini-dsl method used to define a routes extension
    // by contributing Units
    define(url, route) {
      _routes.push([url, route])
    },

    collect() {
      return { routes: _routes }
    }
  }
})

// the extensions provided by other Units are passed on via the
// dependencies object
const Router = Unit(({ routes }) => {
  // given a URL the router 'navigates' to it
  navigate(url) {

    const route = findRoute(routes, url)
    return route.invoke()
  }
})

const findRoute = (routes, url) =>
  routes
    .map(extension => extension.routes)
    .flatten()
    .find(r => r[0] == url)

export default Router
```
AppDelegate
The extension slot definition takes a function that produces a new **extension** for that
slot, everytime it is called (it will be called for every Unit that wants to provide
extensions to that slot).

The **extension** itself, is an object that is required to respond to the a no-arg `collect()` method.
The method should return the extension data that would be fed in the unit that delcared it. The
returned value has to be an JS Object.

That extension instance should also provide a mini-dsl used to define an extension. In this case,
that's the `define` method, which is used to define a route.

The Unit that declares the **extension slot** receives all the _contributed extensions_ via
the dependency mechanism.

In the example above, the `routes` object is an _extension slot_ defined by the `router` Unit.
The `router` Unit acceptes _contributed extensions_ by declaring a `routes` dependency.

To contribute routes (extensions) another Unit does:

```javascript
import { Unit, using, contributions } from '@skele/system'
import { routesSlot } from './Router'

const App = Unit(({ router }) => {})

// create the extenison of the routes slot provided by the App sbusystems
export const routes = routesSlot(App)

App.routes = routes // "classic" compatibility

// use the DSL of the extension to shape it, in this case
// defining some routes that the App Unit handles
routes.define('http://example.com', url => fetch(url))

export default App
```

Finally, to wire things together in a system one would:

```javascript
import { System } from '@skele/system'

import Router, { routesSlot } from './Router'
import App from './App'

export default System({
  router: using({ routes: contributions(routesSlot) }, Router),
  app: using(['router'], App),
})
```

The `contributions(extensionSlot)` method will insert a special dependency
marker for the system that causes it to collect available extensions (by calling
the `collect()` method on Units that contrbute and pass them on as a dependency.

### Extensions and subsystems

When nesting Subsystems, the follwing rules apply:

- The extensions defined in the surounding subsystem will propageate into the encapsulated one.
  In other words units in the outer subsystem can contribute to units in the encapsulated one.
- The extensions defined in the encapsulated subsystem _will not_ propagate to the outer one
  In other words, including a subsystem doesn't into another doesn't risk unwanted
  altering of the behavior of the the outer one.
- Subsystems that wish to explicitly "export" contributions to surrounding subsystems should
  - either define them on the subsystem object
  - or use the `exportExtensions` feature

## Ordering of Units (and extensions)

When a Unit uses extensions, the order in which these extensions are delivered
to a Unit often becomes important. E.g. when multiple routes match a given,
URL, which one is given precedence?

The framework will pass on extensions to a Unit **in the order in which it
instantiated the Units**.

When you are defining a System (using an object as specification), this order will be
detrmined by the _enumeration order_ (`for .. in`) of the properties of the specification,
minimally adjusted so that the dependencies of a Unit are instantiated before it itself
is instantiated (topological sort).

Even though the JS specification states that the `for...in` enumeration order is not defined
for objects, In most JS environments, this enumeration order will be the order in which the properties
appear in the object literal, e.g. for

```javascript
const sys = System({
  router: using({ x: 'x', routes: contributions(routesSlot) }, router),
  approutes: approutes,
  x: y,
})
```

The enumeration order will be `[router, approutes, x]`, and consequently the ordering of the Units
will be `[x, router, approutes]` (`x` goes in front of `router` because it is a dependency).

If it is vital for your app to make sure this order is predictable accross JS envs, then you may also
use the _array of touples_ form (same form as the result of `Object.entries()`) to specify
the system:

```javascript
const sys = System([
  ['router', using({ x: 'x', routes: contributions(routesSlot) }, router)],
  ['approutes', approutes],
  ['x', y],
])
```

This way the Unit instantiation order, and therefore the **extension order** will be stable in all
environments.

But ultimately, if you wish that an extension provided by Unit `A` has more precedence (comes later in
the extension order) than the extension provided by Unit `B`, it is better **not to rely on the instantiation
order at all**, but to make this ordering more explicit. You can do that by just introducing `B` as dependency
of `A`, even though you aren't accessing this object:

```javascript
const sys = System({
  router: using({ x: 'x', routes: contributions(routesSlot) }, router),
  productRoutes: productroutes,
  tenantRoutes: using(['productRoutes'], tenantRoutes),
  x: y,
})
```

By making `productRoutes` a dependency of `tenantRoutes` we make sure the in the order in which
extensions are passed to the `router`, the tenant routes will always come after product routes.

To make this intent more clear, we've made `after` an alias for `using`. So you would write:

```javascript
import { System, contributions, using, after } from '@skele/system'

import router, { routesSlot } from './router'
import productRoutes from './productRoutes'
import tenantRoutes from './tenantRoutes'
import y from './y'

const sys = System({
  router: using({ x: 'x', routes: contributions(routesSlot) }, router),
  productRoutes: productroutes,
  tenantRoutes: after(['productRoutes'], tenantRoutes),
  x: y,
})
```
